# Jenkins-SonarQube-Docker
This is a practical exploration on how to set up a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline using Github, Sonarqube, and Docker on an AWS EC2 instance. 

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate tasks in software development including building, testing, and deploying.

Github is a code repository that provides version control and collaboration tools.

Sonarqube is a code quality management tool that helps analyze and manage code quality in software projects. 

Docker is a container platform which helps simplify the deployment of software applications.

First, I will create an AWS EC2 instance and install Jenkins on it. We will then set up a Github repository and integrate it with Jenkins. Next, I will configure Sonarqube to analyze code quality in our Github repository. 
Finally, I will create a Docker image of our application and deploy it using Jenkins.

By the end, it should be sufficient to gain insights on how to set up a CI/CD pipeline among Jenkins, Github, Sonarqube, and Docker on an AWS EC2 instance.
